## Prompt 1

We are creating a webapplication `ManageMyClinic`. Look in the README.md for overview, users, roles and features


## Prompt 2

Let's create a "constitution" in a specs directory:
- `mission.md`
- `tech-stack.md`
- `roadmap.md` for high-level implementation order, in very small phases of work.

Important: You *must* use your AskUserQuestion tool, grouped on these 3, before writing to disk.

## Prompt 3

ind the next phase on specs/roadmap.md and make a branch, ask me about the feature spec.
Create:
 - A new directory YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name under specs for this feature work
 - In there:
  - `plan.md` as a series of numbered task groups.
  - `requirements.md` for the scope, decisions, context
  - `validation.md` for how to know the implementation succeeded and can be merged

Refer to specs/mission.md and specs/tech-stack.md for guidance.

Important: You *must* use your AskUserQuestion tool, grouped on these 3, before writing to disk.

## Prompt 4

Add a task group to the plan to have a minimal AgentClinic home page and update the rest of the feature spec to be in sync.

## Prompt 5

Update specs/roadmap.md add a phase after phase 1 to have hello my clinic
- Install and configure app with `tsx` dev server
- Single `/` route returning "ManageMyClinic is open for business"
- Confirm TypeScript types work end-to-end
